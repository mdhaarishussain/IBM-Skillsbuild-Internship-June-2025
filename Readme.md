An Advanced ML model to predict whether an employee earns >$50K or ‚â§$50K. A Project by Md Haaris Hussain üéì EDUNET FOUNDATION - IBM SKILLSBUILD AI INTERNSHIP (JUNE 2025)

‚ú® Project Overview
------------------

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000 based on various demographic and employment-related features. The entire workflow, from data ingestion and rigorous preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and interactive deployment, is meticulously covered. The goal is to provide a user-friendly Streamlit web application for both single and batch predictions, making the power of predictive analytics accessible.

### üéØ Key Goals:

-   **Data Exploration & Cleaning:** Load and thoroughly explore the Adult Census Income dataset, identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

-   **Feature Engineering:** Transform raw categorical features into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms (e.g., using Label Encoding).

-   **Model Development:** Train and fine-tune multiple classification algorithms to find the optimal model for income prediction.

-   **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of trained models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

-   **Interactive Deployment:** Deploy the best-performing model as an intuitive Streamlit web application, enabling real-time and batch predictions.

üíæ Dataset
----------

The project leverages the **Adult Census Income Dataset**, a widely recognized benchmark dataset for classification tasks, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

-   **File:**  `adult 3 (1).csv`

-   **Description:** This dataset contains information extracted from the 1994 Census database, encompassing various demographic and employment-related features for individuals. The primary target variable is `income`, indicating whether an individual's annual income is `<=50K` or `>50K`.

### Key Features:

-   `age`: Continuous.

-   `workclass`: Categorical (e.g., Private, Self-emp-not-inc, Local-gov, ?).

-   `fnlwgt`: Continuous (final weight - the number of people the census believes the entry represents).

-   `education`: Categorical (e.g., HS-grad, Some-college, Bachelors).

-   `educational-num`: Continuous (numerical representation of education level).

-   `marital-status`: Categorical.

-   `occupation`: Categorical (e.g., Tech-support, Craft-repair, Sales, ?).

-   `relationship`: Categorical.

-   `race`: Categorical.

-   `gender`: Binary (Male, Female).

-   `capital-gain`: Continuous.

-   `capital-loss`: Continuous.

-   `hours-per-week`: Continuous.

-   `native-country`: Categorical (e.g., United-States, Mexico, ?).

-   `income`: **Target Variable** (Categorical: `<=50K`, `>50K`).

üß† Model
--------

The core of this project is a machine learning model trained to classify income levels.

-   **Model File:**  `best_model.pkl`

-   **Algorithm:** Based on the `employee_salary_prediction.ipynb` notebook, the best-performing model chosen is a `GradientBoostingClassifier`. This model is serialized using `joblib` for efficient loading and prediction within the web application.

-   **Preprocessors:** The `app.py` also includes logic to load or create default `LabelEncoder` instances for categorical features, ensuring consistent preprocessing between training and inference.

üöÄ Application
--------------

The project includes an interactive web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to make predictions effortlessly.

-   **Application File:**  `app.py`

-   **Live Application:**  <https://employeesalarypredictionedunet.streamlit.app/>

-   **Features:**

    -   **Single Prediction:** Input individual features through a user-friendly form to get an instant salary class prediction.

    -   **Batch Prediction:** Upload a CSV file containing multiple entries to receive predictions and confidence scores for each, with an option to download the results.

    -   **Modern UI:** Features a dark mode theme with a clean and responsive design.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
--------------------------

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd employee-salary-classification

    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file contains:

    ```
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    streamlit
    joblib

    ```

4.  **Ensure model and data files are present:** Make sure `adult 3 (1).csv` and `best_model.pkl` are in the root directory of the project.

üèÉ Usage
--------

To launch the Streamlit web application:

```
streamlit run app.py

```

This command will open the application in your default web browser. You can then interact with the UI to perform single or batch predictions.
